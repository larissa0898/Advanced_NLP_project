### Running
#### tf_idf method
If you want to use the tf_idf-method, you have to run the code in 'tf_idf_extraction.py'. While running the code, you will be asked, whether you want to use the json file with the pre-processed data or wether you want to preprocess the data again and create a new json file (this takes about 10 minutes).
In the end the title of the Wikipedia articles will be printed together with the five keywords, that were generated by the tf_idf method.


#### manual method
If you want to use the manual method, you have to run the code in 'manual extraction.py'. A json file 'manual_extracion.json' will be created with the titles of the Wikipedia articles and the five most frequently occuring words in the Wikipedia texts. This json file can be used to calculate the accuracy with the code in 'accuarcy_manual.py'.
