# Advanced NLP Project - Main Topic Extraction
This repository contains two methods for main topic extraction with Wikipedia articles. One with tf-idf and the other one is frequency-based (count most frequently words/lemmas in text).  
In the further course, the two methods are compared with each other on the basis of some statistics.

## Data
The data (Wikipedia articles) were generated by [this page](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spezial:Exportieren). 
Through the page you get the articles sorted by a category, e.g. 'Klettern', written into an XML file. 


## Installation 
Download all the files on this GitHub repository.  
With 'pip install -r requirements.txt' all required libraries are installed.

## Usage
### tf-idf method
If you want to use the tf_idf-method, you have to run the code in 'tf_idf_extraction.py'. While the programm is running, you will be asked, whether you want to use the existing json file with the pre-processed data ('corpus.json') or whether you want to pre-process the data again and create a new json file (this takes about 8 minutes).

In the end, the title of the Wikipedia articles will be printed together with the five keywords, that were generated by the tf-idf method. In the last line the accuracy will be printed.

### frequency-based method
If you want to use the frequency-based method, you have to run the code in 'frequency-based_extraction.py'. You will be asked, if you want to extract the data with the frequency-based method again or if you want to use the existing data in the json file 'frequency-based_extraction.json'.  
If you press 'y' a new json file 'frequency-based_extraction.json' will be created with the titles of the Wikipedia articles and the five most frequently occuring words/lemmas in the Wikipedia texts.   
After that you will be asked, if you want to calculate the accuracy for this method. If you press 'y' the total accuracy will be printed.
